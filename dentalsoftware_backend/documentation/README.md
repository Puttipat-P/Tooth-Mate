# API Documentation

## Introduction
----
These documents will help you understand how to properly interact with the API in a manner which is consistent with the rest of the teams code.

Each page will outline all the relevant details about the listed endpoint, including what data it will send back to you, what data it requires to be sent, what errors it will send, and any other relevant information.

PLEASE NOTE: All API requests should be done using the `Axios` library, this can be imported with `import axios from 'axios';`. The `Axios` library should be included in the `package.json` file already and installed the last time you ran `npm install` but if you cannot import the library then please re-run `npm install`. Please do not use any other library to communicate with the API.
